# MoviesDataAnalysis


This project is based on developing a solution for data analysis to optimize processes. The main goal of this project was to process and analyze complex data from multiple sources to provide useful and relevant information that supports decision-making regarding a movie to watch.

For this objective, I used three CSV files containing a significant volume of raw information. These data were processed by eliminating redundant or irrelevant attributes, filling in missing values, and transforming them to be compatible with further analysis.

The technologies and tools used for data processing and analysis were Python with the Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries for graphical visualization of the results. Additionally, I employed data processing and mining techniques to identify patterns and extract relevant information.

Through this project, I was able to develop practical skills in data processing, problem-solving, collaboration, and the use of advanced technologies.
